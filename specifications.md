# Game Design Specifications
This is my plan to create software to gamify my life in order to supplement
progress towards my goals in a healthy way.

Perhaps while developing this we can start with employing it.

## A clear goal to work towards
Maybe have a set of highly personalized goals to choose from that can be 
easily measured. Mine are listed below in the rewards section.

Measurables: 
- time spent in iterm 
- time spent in editor 
- time spent on useful websites 
- time spent off unproductive websites (Netflix, YouTube, etc)
- commits to gh
- number of workouts accomplished 
- activity score (Oura)
- sleep score  (Oura)
- time meditated (Insight Timer)
(could be scaled non linearly by number of days in a row due to compounding 
benefit) 
- time spent off phone while studying (Forest)

## Visible, fast improving progress. (Progress bars, levels)
We don't want to see that we are .7% to level 99, but we do want to see that we
are 70% to level 2. Also want to see multiple progress bars going on. Each
individual goal will have it's own progress bar that is as visible as possible.

## Rewards that reinforce the goal
We often reward ourselves with things that hurt our goals. Like cake after
following a diet. This is not helpful, instead rewards should supplement the
goal being worked towards. However, they need to exhibit novelty and still
be as rewarding as possible. 

Perhaps we can rank the rewards below based on what level they
should be available (perhaps on value... some of that shit is expensive). 
The user should choose what goal they actually want at some point before they 
reach that level.

One of the rewards could be shopping for new rewards... Since shopping is
designed to be rewarding in itself, and this will make the game self sustaining.
We could assign a monetary value to a level up based on what level it is and
work put in towards achieving it.

#### Rewards for current goals (Kevyn personal)
All this may sound very expensive, but keep in mind levels will take
exponentially longer to achieve and a lot of this is stuff I'd buy anyway

### Meditation (Things that support a healthy mind)
- Singing bowl?
- Inscence?
- Meditation cusion?
- https://hapbee.com/
- Essential oils

### Working out (Things that support a healthy and attractive body)
- Shoes
- Cool gym clothing (gloves, shirts, shorts, leggings, gym bag)
- Gym equipment (foam roller, muscle impactor, bands?)
- sex? (would require partner participation)
- Tanning
- Spa things
- IV vitamins
- Massages
- Healthy but delicious food. Something I normally wouldn't spend money on

### Learning (Things that support learning)
- Upgraded editing, productivity, automation tools (inherent to programming)
- Better desk setup
- New books
- New courses
- New computer
- A kindle maybe?
- Tutoring?

### Making money (Things that support gaining more wealth)
- Investing (Not sure how rewarding this is though)

### Self Care, particularly brushing my teeth (don't judge I struggle with this)
- Dope new toothbrush
- Cool new toothpaste
- New soaps, bodywashes, shampoos, etc

### Applies to most
- Clothing
- New living place
- Supplements/nootropics
- Coffee stuff

## Challenges that match current skill level
Challenges that are too overwhelming need to be broken down into smaller ones.
Challenges that are too easy need to be made harder. Everything needs to be a 
constant challenge though, but not too challenging. Set a time limit for easy 
tasks, automate things as much as possible.

## Other important stuff
Levels should get exponentially harder to level up... This is so that we don't
go broke rewarding ourselves and the game stays challenging. There will be some
fine tuning involved in figuring out what's the optimal reward frequency for
certain tasks. Perhaps this can be done by propting the gamer for a servey of 
things like happiness level, motivation, energy, desire to continue playing and
such every day. This activity can be rewarded in itself.

Consistancy should be valued higher than anything else as it is a sign of a
habit forming and the only way towards actual improvement and goal 
achievement.
